					<p>I am originally from Guatemala, where I went to high school, while also traveling extensively through the world with my parents to exotic locations. Among those locations we repeatedly traveled to Miami, so I have got to know that city pretty well. I have also extensively traveled to Germany (to practice my German). Thus, I feel comfortable pretty much anywhere in the world and think of it as my home!</p>
					<p>For college I went to Penn State where I graduated with degrees in: Energy Business and Finance Energy Systems Option, Energy Engineering, Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering, and Mining Engineering</p>
					<p>After college I continued taking numerous courses with Harvard Business School, as well as with Georgetown and INCAE on Hospital and Health Administration, while also completing several computer science courses.</p>
					<p>I did also earn a post-graduate degree from Penn State in Solar Energy, so not all my education has been alternative...</p>
					<p>On top of those courses, I also gained certification from LEED for BD+C due to my interest in Energy and Natural Resources, and how our civilization interacts with them.</p>
					<p>I've worked with my familiy on their retail and distribution business in Guatemala all my life, while also helping my father recently in his medical businesses. I also worked in an Oil firm in Belize with Petroleum Engineering and Financial Anlysis Projects. After working for the oil firm, I went back to work with my family and started my own section of the company in the US, Luszol LLC which has done several solar PV installations, but has pivoted to a more comprehensive outlook on energy, targeting numerous sources of generation for a smarter, more reliable, and decentralized grid!</p>
