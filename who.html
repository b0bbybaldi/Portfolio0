					Who am I?

				<hr>

				<br>
				
				<p>I am originally from Guatemala, where I went up to high school, while also traveling extensively though the world with my parents to exotic locations, repetitively to Miami (where we have a place) and extensively to Germany (to practice my German, which I learn since my grandmother is German). Thus, I feel comfortable pretty much anywhere and think fo the world as my home!</p>
				
				<p>For college I went to Penn State where I graduated with degrees on: Energy Business and Finance Energy Systems Option, Energy Engineering, Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering, and Mining Engineering</p>
			   	
				<p>After college I continued taking numerous courses with Harvard Business School in Business, as well as with Georgetown and INCAE on Hospital and Health Administration, while also completing several computer science and coding courses.</p>
			   	
				<p>I did also earn a post-graduate degree from Penn State in Solar Energy, so not all my education has been alternative...</p>
				
				<p>While taking all those courses I also gained certification from LEED for BD+C due to my interest in Energy and Natural Resources, and how our civilization interacts with them</p>
			   	
				<p>Work-wise I've worked with my familiy on their retail and distribution business in Guatemala all my life, while also helping my father recently in his medical businesses. I also worked in Petroleum Engineering and Financial Anlysis Projects in Belize (my grandfather was born there in British colonial times) with a local oul firm. After working for the oil firm, I went back to work with my family and started my own section of the company in the US, Luszlol LLC which has done several solar PV installations but has pivoted to a more comprehensive outlook on energy, targeting numerous sources of generation for a smarter, more reliable, and decentralized grid!</p>
